  # gcc sometimes warns (e.g. about potentially uninitialized variables) only
  # when some optimizations are enabled. So we build Debug as well as Release
  # on Linux. The Debug build also collects and uploads test coverage.

  # 64-bit one does Release build. (Full matrix would likely be an overkill.)
