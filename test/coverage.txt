# Coverage

This file is just a collection of unit tests not covered elsewhere.

Most notably regression tests, tests improving code coverage and other useful
things may drop here.

(However any tests requiring any additional command line option, like enabling
an extension, must be included in their respective files.)

## Code coverage

### `md_is_unicode_whitespace__()`

Unicode whitespace (here U+2000) forms a word boundary so these cannot be
resolved as emphasis span because there is no closer mark.

```````````````````````````````` example
*foo *bar
.
<p>*foo *bar</p>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_is_unicode_punct__()`

Ditto for Unicode punctuation (here U+00A1).

```````````````````````````````` example
*foo¡*bar
.
<p>*foo¡*bar</p>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_get_unicode_fold_info()`

```````````````````````````````` example
[Příliš žluťoučký kůň úpěl ďábelské ódy.]

[PŘÍLIŠ ŽLUŤOUČKÝ KŮŇ ÚPĚL ĎÁBELSKÉ ÓDY.]: /url
.
<p><a href="/url">Příliš žluťoučký kůň úpěl ďábelské ódy.</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_decode_utf8__()` and `md_decode_utf8_before__()`

```````````````````````````````` example
á*Á (U+00E1, i.e. two byte UTF-8 sequence)
 *  (U+2000, i.e. three byte UTF-8 sequence)
.
<p>á*Á (U+00E1, i.e. two byte UTF-8 sequence)
 *  (U+2000, i.e. three byte UTF-8 sequence)</p>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_is_link_destination_A()`


```````````````````````````````` example
[link](</url\.with\.escape>)
.
<p><a href="/url.with.escape">link</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_link_label_eq()`


```````````````````````````````` example
[foo bar]

[foo bar]: /url
.
<p><a href="/url">foo bar</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_is_inline_link_spec()`

```````````````````````````````` example
> [link](/url 'foo
> bar')
.
<blockquote>
<p><a href="/url" title="foo
bar">link</a></p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````
