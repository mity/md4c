With the flag `MD_FLAG_LATEXMATHSPANS`, MD4C enables extension for recognition
of LaTeX style math spans.

A math span is is any text wrapped in dollars or double dollars (`$...$` or
`$$...$$`).

```````````````````````````````` example
$a+b=c$ Hello, world!
.
<p><x-equation>a+b=c</x-equation> Hello, world!</p>
````````````````````````````````

If the double dollar sign is used, the math span is a display math span.

```````````````````````````````` example
This is a display equation: $$\int_a^b x dx$$.
.
<p>This is a display equation: <x-equation type="display">\int_a^b x dx</x-equation>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Math spans may span multiple lines as they are normal spans:

```````````````````````````````` example
$$
\int_a^b
f(x) dx
$$
.
<p><x-equation type="display">\int_a^b f(x) dx </x-equation></p>
````````````````````````````````

Note though that many (simple) renderers may output the math spans just as a
verbatim text. (This includes the HTML renderer used by the `md2html` utility.)

Only advanced renderers which implement LaTeX math syntax can be expected to
provide better results.
