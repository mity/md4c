# Tables

With the flag `MD_FLAG_TABLES`, MD4C enables extension for recognition of
tables.

Basic table example of a table with two columns and three lines (when not
counting the header) is as follows:

```````````````````````````````` example
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| foo      | bar      |
| baz      | qux      |
| quux     | quuz     |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Column 1</th><th>Column 2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>foo</td><td>bar</td></tr>
<tr><td>baz</td><td>qux</td></tr>
<tr><td>quux</td><td>quuz</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

The leading and succeeding pipe characters (`|`) on each line are optional:

```````````````````````````````` example
Column 1 | Column 2 |
---------|--------- |
foo      | bar      |
baz      | qux      |
quux     | quuz     |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Column 1</th><th>Column 2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>foo</td><td>bar</td></tr>
<tr><td>baz</td><td>qux</td></tr>
<tr><td>quux</td><td>quuz</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
| Column 1 | Column 2
|----------|---------
| foo      | bar
| baz      | qux
| quux     | quuz
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Column 1</th><th>Column 2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>foo</td><td>bar</td></tr>
<tr><td>baz</td><td>qux</td></tr>
<tr><td>quux</td><td>quuz</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
Column 1 | Column 2
---------|---------
foo      | bar
baz      | qux
quux     | quuz
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Column 1</th><th>Column 2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>foo</td><td>bar</td></tr>
<tr><td>baz</td><td>qux</td></tr>
<tr><td>quux</td><td>quuz</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

However for one-column table, at least one of those has to be used, otherwise
it would be parsed as a Setext title followed by paragraph.

```````````````````````````````` example
Column 1
--------
foo
baz
quux
.
<h2>Column 1</h2>
<p>foo
baz
quux</p>
````````````````````````````````

Leading and trailing whitespace in a table cell is ignored and the columns do
not need to be aligned.

```````````````````````````````` example
Column 1 |Column 2
---|---
foo | bar
baz| qux
quux|quuz
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Column 1</th><th>Column 2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>foo</td><td>bar</td></tr>
<tr><td>baz</td><td>qux</td></tr>
<tr><td>quux</td><td>quuz</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

The table cannot interrupt a paragraph.

```````````````````````````````` example
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
| Column 1 | Column 2
| ---------|---------
| foo      | bar
| baz      | qux
| quux     | quuz
.
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
| Column 1 | Column 2
| ---------|---------
| foo      | bar
| baz      | qux
| quux     | quuz</p>
````````````````````````````````

But paragraph or other block can interrupt a table as a line without any pipe
ends the table.

```````````````````````````````` example
Column 1 | Column 2
---------|---------
foo      | bar
baz      | qux
quux     | quuz
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Column 1</th><th>Column 2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>foo</td><td>bar</td></tr>
<tr><td>baz</td><td>qux</td></tr>
<tr><td>quux</td><td>quuz</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
````````````````````````````````

The ruling line between head and body of the table must include the same amount
of cells as the line with column names, and each cell has to consist of three
dash (`-`) characters. However first, last or both dashes may be replaced with
colon to denote column alignment.

Thus this is not a table because there are too few dashes for Column 2.

```````````````````````````````` example
| Column 1 | Column 2
| ---------|--
| foo      | bar
| baz      | qux
| quux     | quuz
.
<p>| Column 1 | Column 2
| ---------|--
| foo      | bar
| baz      | qux
| quux     | quuz</p>
````````````````````````````````

And this is a table where each of the four column uses different alignment.

```````````````````````````````` example
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
|----------|:---------|:--------:|---------:|
| default  | left     | center   | right    |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Column 1</th><th align="left">Column 2</th><th align="center">Column 3</th><th align="right">Column 4</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>default</td><td align="left">left</td><td align="center">center</td><td align="right">right</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

To include a literal pipe character in any cell, it has to be escaped.

```````````````````````````````` example
Column 1 | Column 2
---------|---------
foo      | bar
baz      | qux \| xyzzy
quux     | quuz
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Column 1</th><th>Column 2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>foo</td><td>bar</td></tr>
<tr><td>baz</td><td>qux | xyzzy</td></tr>
<tr><td>quux</td><td>quuz</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

Contents of each cell is parsed as an inline text which may contents any
inline Markdown spans like emphasis, strong emphasis, links etc.

```````````````````````````````` example
Column 1 | Column 2
---------|---------
*foo*    | bar
**baz**  | [qux]
quux     | [quuz](/url2)

[qux]: /url
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Column 1</th><th>Column 2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><em>foo</em></td><td>bar</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>baz</strong></td><td><a href="/url">qux</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>quux</td><td><a href="/url2">quuz</a></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

However pipes which are inside a code span are not recognized as cell
boundaries.

```````````````````````````````` example
Column 1 | Column 2
---------|---------
`foo     | bar`
baz      | qux
quux     | quuz
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Column 1</th><th>Column 2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><code>foo     | bar</code>
baz      | qux
quux     | quuz</p>

```````````````````````````````` example
* x|x
---|---
.
<ul>
<li>x|x
---|---</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````
(Not a table, because the underline has wrong indentation and is not part of the
list item.)

```````````````````````````````` example
* x|x
  ---|---
x|x
.
<ul>
<li><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>x</th>
<th>x</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
</ul>
<p>x|x</p>
````````````````````````````````
(Here the underline has the right indentation so the table is detected.
But the last line is not part of it due its indentation.)
