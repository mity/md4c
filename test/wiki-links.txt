# Wiki Links

With the flag `MD_FLAG_WIKILINKS`, MD4C recognizes wiki links.

A wiki link is ...

```````````````````````````````` example
[[foo]]
.
<p><x-wikilink data-target="foo">foo</x-wikilink></p>
````````````````````````````````

The link target of a wiki link cannot span more than one line:

```````````````````````````````` example
[[foo
bar]]
.
<p>[[foo
bar]]</p>
````````````````````````````````

The link target is rendered verbatim; inline markup is not recognized.

```````````````````````````````` example
[[*foo*]]
.
<p><x-wikilink data-target="*foo*">*foo*</x-wikilink></p>
````````````````````````````````

Wiki links are prioritized over regular links.

```````````````````````````````` example
[[foo]](foo.jpg)
.
<p><x-wikilink data-target="foo">foo</x-wikilink>(foo.jpg)</p>
````````````````````````````````
