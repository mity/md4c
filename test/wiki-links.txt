# Wiki Links

With the flag `MD_FLAG_WIKILINKS`, MD4C recognizes wiki links.

A wiki link is ...

```````````````````````````````` example
[[foo]]
.
<p><x-wikilink data-target="foo">foo</x-wikilink></p>
````````````````````````````````

The link target of a wiki link cannot span more than one line:

```````````````````````````````` example
[[foo
bar]]
.
<p>[[foo
bar]]</p>
````````````````````````````````

The link target is rendered verbatim; inline markup is not recognized.

```````````````````````````````` example
[[*foo*]]
.
<p><x-wikilink data-target="*foo*">*foo*</x-wikilink></p>
````````````````````````````````

Wiki links are prioritized over regular links.

```````````````````````````````` example
[[foo]](foo.jpg)
.
<p><x-wikilink data-target="foo">foo</x-wikilink>(foo.jpg)</p>
````````````````````````````````

Something that may look like a wiki link at first, but turns out not to be,
is recognized as a normal link.

```````````````````````````````` example
[[foo]

[foo]: /url
.
<p>[<a href="/url">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

Escaping the opening `[`, we should get a normal link.

```````````````````````````````` example
\[[foo]]
.
<p>[<a href="/url">foo</a>]</p>
````````````````````````````````

Like normal links, the innermost wiki link is preferred.

```````````````````````````````` example
[[foo[[bar]]]]
.
<p>[[foo<x-wikilink data-target="bar">bar</x-wikilink>]]</p>
````````````````````````````````


There is limit of 100 characters inside a wiki link target (or id); 101
characters is too much.

```````````````````````````````` example
[[12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901]]
.
<p>[[12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901]]</p>
````````````````````````````````

100 characters inside a wiki link target works.

```````````````````````````````` example
[[1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890]]
.
<p><x-wikilink data-target="1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890">1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890</x-wikilink></p>
